My first readme

This project is to help me practice aking actions and navigating through GitHub from the CLI.
I cloned the repository, made changes to the local repository and pushed the changes. I also, created a new local branch and used best practice to push new local branc to remote to avoid conflicts during future push and pull requests. It was fun.
